Elizaur Reyes, Kristin Gumbert, Salwador Szurlej

	
Project Description: Pizza Planet will be an interactive map app that will allow users to settle the score of which establishment in New Jersey has superior pizza. Utilizing our search, users will be able to select and upvote (maybe comment) their favorite pizza places. Upvoted pizza places will appear on the map with a yelp modal indicating data like a phone number, 5 star rating, and other pertinent information. When an adequate amount of data is collected, the highest voted counties/pizza places will be displayed in a (pizza) pie chart. 

APIs:The APIs that will be used for this project are Google Maps, Yelp, and Factual. Using established restaurant information and geographical locations in order to pair data and display it on the map.

Task Breakdown: In regards to a breakdown of tasks, we have agreed to all collaborate on the front end and finish it by this coming thursday. After that, we will compartmentalize the backend once we have a working skeleton of the site.
